## About Me

Hi! I am a 1th-year Phd candidate in the School of Electronic Science and Engineering at Nanjing University. I am supervised by Professor Li Du and Yuan Du at [ISCL lab](https://iscl.nju.edu.cn/42924/list.htm). Prior to this, I obtained a bachelor's degree from Northeast Forestry University and was later admitted to Nanjing University through recommendation (<strong>ranking 1/111</strong>).

If you have any questions, I very welcome you to contact me.

## Research Interests

With the increasing demand for computing power and bandwidth in LLM training/inference, exploring collaborative optimization across multiple system levels is an important direction to improve the overall efficiency of the system. Therefore, my main research now is the </strong>design and optimization of AI accelerator scale-up network</strong>. From the two dimensions of hardware design and software modeling, I explore system optimization methods among multiple system levels through </strong>cross-layer co design</strong>, such as deployment layer, AI accelerator layer, communication layer and interconnection layer, to improve the overall performance of AI system.

I am currently building a scale-up prototype system on hardware, and at the same time, developing a software performance model    
## News

- **[Nov. 2024]** I have been awarded the <strong>National Scholarship</strong>.
- **[Jan. 2024]** My paper about software and hardware Co-design for accelerating CNN inference is accepted to IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems(TCAD,<strong>CCF-A</strong>).

## Internship
- **[Jun. 2024 - Sep. 2024]** Research Intern in the System Architecture Group of Penglai Lab at Tencent(ShenZhen)
