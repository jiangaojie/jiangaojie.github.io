## About Me

Hi! I am a 3th-year Master candidate in the School of Electronic Science and Engineering at Nanjing University. I am supervised by Professor Yuan Du and Li Du at [ISCL lab](https://iscl.nju.edu.cn/42924/list.htm). My research interests include efficient inference of AI algorithms (such as quantization and pruning) and hardware acceleration for AI. I also have a great interest in the architecture of NPU/GPU and high-performance FPGA design.

If you have any questions or cooperation, please feel free to contact me.

## Research Interests

- **Software:** Quantization or Compression methods for CNN and LLMs
- **Hardware:** Efficient hardware acceleration for AI algorithms
    
    Now, I am focusing on the domain specific systems for efficient LLM deployment 
    
## News

- **[Nov. 2024]** I have been awarded the <strong>National Scholarship</strong>.
- **[Jan. 2024]** My paper about software and hardware Co-design for CNN is accepted to IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems(TCAD,<strong>CCF-A</strong>).

## Internship
- **[Jun. 2024 - Sep. 2024]** Research Intern as a chip architect in Penglai Lab at Tencent(ShenZhen)
