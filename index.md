## About Me

I am a Master student at Nanjing University. My research interests include efficient inference of AI algorithms (such as quantization and pruning) and hardware acceleration for AI. I also have a great interest in the architecture of NPU/GPU and high-performance FPGA design.

If you have any questions or cooperation, please feel free to contact me.

## Research Interests

- **Software:** Quantization or Compression for CNN and LLMs
- **Hardware:** Efficient hardware acceleration for all kinds of AI algorithms

## News

- **[Jan. 2024]** My paper about software and hardware Co-design for CNN is accepted to IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems(TCAD,CCF-A).
