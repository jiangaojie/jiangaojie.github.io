## About Me

Hi! I am a 3th-year Master candidate in the School of Electronic Science and Engineering at Nanjing University. My research interests include efficient inference of AI algorithms (such as quantization and pruning) and hardware acceleration for AI. I also have a great interest in the architecture of NPU/GPU and high-performance FPGA design.

If you have any questions or cooperation, please feel free to contact me.

## Research Interests

- **Software:** Quantization or Compression methods for CNN and LLMs
- **Hardware:** Efficient hardware acceleration for AI algorithms

## News

- **[Jan. 2024]** My paper about software and hardware Co-design for CNN is accepted to IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems(TCAD,CCF-A).

## Internship
- **[Jun. 2024 - Sep. 2024]** Research Intern in Penglai Lab at Tencent(ShenZhen)
